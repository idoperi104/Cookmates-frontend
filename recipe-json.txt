Sure, here are some additional details you could consider when building a recipe-sharing app:

1. User accounts and profiles: Allow users to create accounts and profiles where they can save 
their favorite recipes, follow other users, and share their own recipes. This can help build 
a sense of community and engagement around the app.

2. Advanced search and filtering: Incorporate advanced search and filtering options that allow 
users to find recipes based on specific ingredients, dietary restrictions, or meal types. This 
can make it easier for users to find recipes that meet their needs and preferences.

3. Recipe rating and reviews: Allow users to rate and review recipes, and display the ratings 
and reviews on each recipe page. This can help users make informed decisions about which recipes 
to try, and can help highlight popular or high-quality recipes.

4. Recipe sharing and social media integration: Allow users to share recipes on social media 
platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and incorporate social media features like likes and comments. 
This can help increase the app's visibility and engagement on social media.

5. Meal planning and grocery list features: Incorporate meal planning and grocery list features 
that allow users to plan their meals for the week and generate a shopping list based on the recipes 
they plan to make. This can help make the app more useful and valuable to users.

Remember to focus on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing app that makes it easy for 
users to find and share recipes. Incorporate features that add value and make the app stand out 
from other recipe-sharing apps. Good luck with your project!
